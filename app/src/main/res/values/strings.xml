Addison’s Walk is a path and uneven in places and tree roots can also be an obstacle. There is no access on the eastern side of the Bat Willow Bridge. The entrance to the College (the Porters’ Lodge on the High Street) is not suited to wheelchair users but there is a bell push to contact the porter who can open the adjacent gates to give access. Other entrances (which are normally locked) are better suited to wheelchairs and are usable by those who are accompanied by a Member of College. The Chapel is level going and easily accessible by wheelchair. The Hall has a wheelchair lift for those attending meals. It is regretted that since there is no staff member available in the afternoons, this lift is not available for use by tourists. The Longwall Library has a lift for disabled access. The Summer Common Room has a lift on Cloisters III for disabled access. By prior arrangement, this can also be used for access to the Old Library. Most other areas of the College, including some ground floor locations, are not suited to wheelchair access.</string>

It usually lasts just over an hour. Those of any and all denominations are welcome to receive Communion in Chapel; it’s equally fine to attend and not take Communion. The service is followed by lunch and wine or a soft drink in the New Room, to which all are invited. 6.00pm Choral Evensong Perhaps the most distinctively Anglican of all church services is Evensong, which took shape in the sixteenth century when the medieval orders for Vespers and Compline were combined, in the Book of Common Prayer, to create a new service. Evensong at Magdalen uses the traditional language of the 1662 Prayer Book and it offers the opportunity to hear a great variety of musical settings of the canticles (Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis), along with a wide range of anthems and psalm chants. This service typically lasts around 40 minutes, or 50 minutes on Saturday and Sunday when it includes congregational hymns. On Sundays, the service is followed by refreshments in the Antechapel.</string>
